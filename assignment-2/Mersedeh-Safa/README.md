## Description

The purpose of this repository is to submit the files that were created for completing the Unix and Data Assignment of the DSI: Unix Shell, Git and GitHub course (https://github.com/UofT-DSI/01-intro_shell_git_github). 

## Details of the Assignment

For this assignment multiple functions were built in a script to print specific information such as parking infraction types and min and max fine from the Toronto 2020 parking ticket data csv file. In addition, the three columns of the infraction type, the amount of fine, and location were extracted to a new csv file.

## Structure

1.	*inputs* folder contains the main csv file and the screenshots of the printed results in the terminal.
2.	*outputs* folder contains the new saved csv file.
3.	*scripts* folder contains the shell script.
