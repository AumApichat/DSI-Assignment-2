# 1. Name of the Project
## Assignment 1- Unix and Data

# 2. Description
## The project is to run a script (assignment1.sh), which takes the input (parking-2020-03.csv) as a positional parameter from the terminal as an input.
## The script is made up of functions that print all the types of parking infraction (infraction_description), prints the min and max fine amounts (set_fine_amount).
## Lastly, there is a loop, which takes one parking infraction of our choosing, and saves it to the output file (output.csv). 
## This output contains infraction_description, set_fine_amount, and location2, which are all the original csv file headings.
