## project description
There are components necessary to run Assignment 1 with each component placed in the appropriate folder names inputs, outputs, and scripts. Assignment 1's 
goal was to build function(s) into the script that could print from the parking data information in a selected year, 2020 in this case: 
1) all the types of parking infractions 
2) the min and max of fine amount 
and to save the outputs as 1 csv file containing all of observations of the chosen infraction_description, set_fine_amount, and location2 with the same 
headings as the original parking data.

## project usage
The created shell script can be used to assess the min and max of any given dataset as long as the file has been replaced correctly into the created
script.

## installation
To run the shell script, use tool like Visual Studio Code. The tool can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/ depending on the type of 
computer (windows/mac) used.

## list of files
input/noduplicate.txt 
input/Parking_data.csv  
output/output_file.txt  
script/Assignment1.sh - this is a shell script file 

## support
If support is needed for Visual Studio Code installation, find additional instructions or help at https://code.visualstudio.com/learn. If help is needed 
to edit the script, feel free to explor Chat GPT (https://chat.openai.com/chat) and ask the specific questions.
